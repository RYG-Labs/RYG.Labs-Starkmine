StarkMine — Peer-to-Peer Game-Powered Mining on Starknet ￼

1. Concept Overview

StarkMine is a play-to-earn simulation of a proof-of-work (PoW) chain. Players purchase Miner NFTs, “ignite” them with a core-engine, and earn the in-game token $MINE while maintaining and upgrading their equipment. ￼

2. Core Gameplay Loop

Step Action Token Flow Notes
1 Buy Miner NFT (Basic, Elite, Pro, GIGA) Pay $STRK (ticket sale) Tier defines base hash-power
2 Buy matching Core-engine Pay $MINE One core-engine per miner
3 Ignite miner → start mining Earn $MINE daily Emissions halve every 4 weeks
5 Upgrade miner or station Burn / lock $MINE Boost base hash-power or multiplier

2.1 Halving Schedule

Monthly emissions are cut by 50 % every four weeks, mirroring Bitcoin-style halvings. ￼ ￼

3. NFT & Upgrade System

3.1 Miner Tiers

Tier Supply Base Hash-power Bonus Multiplier Ticket / Merge Price
Basic 10 000 10 — 75 $STRK
Elite 1 000 30 +20 % 20 000 $MINE
Pro 200 70 +35 % Merge 2 Elite
GIGA 50 160 +50 % Merge 2 Pro

Upgrading miner hash-power
Levels 1-5; escalating $MINE cost (2k → 310k). 80 % burned, 20 % sent back to the reward pool. ￼

3.2 Station Multiplier Upgrades

Deposit (lock) $MINE to raise account-wide multiplier. Can downgrade but funds unlock after 14 days. ￼

3.3 Merge Mechanics
• Success odds: 5 % (Elite→Pro), 1 % (Pro→GIGA).
• Each failed merge adds +1 % success for the next attempt.
• Cost: 125 $STRK per attempt; success burns source NFTs. ￼

5. Backlog

- Daily “repair” login — Skip login → miner quality falls → reduced hash-power
- Risk-Based “Steal” Mode: Players can scout others’ online status (10 free scouts per day, +10 scouts cost 500 $MINE) and attempt a heist while the target is offline.
- Discounts: Holding partner NFTs grants one discounted mint per collection (75 $STRK → 70 $STRK). ￼
- Staking Pools (MINE/ETH/USDC) on StarkMine, Vesu, Ekubo, AVNU for APR in $MINE.
- Additional Sinks & Sources. Upgrades: major $MINE burn sink.
- Scouting & heists: soft-sink for active players. ￼
- User-Retention Mechanics:
  • Mechanic Effect on Earnings
  • Maintenance ≥ 80 % Full hash-power
  • 50 – 79 % -10 % earnings
  • 20 – 49 % -15 % earnings
  • < 20 % -25 % earnings
- Daily login resets maintenance; failure triggers gradual degradation. ￼
- Referral Program: Each user link yields the referrer 2 % of the referee’s claimed mining rewards (deducted from the referee). ￼
- Future Expansion — Spaceship Phase (Draft): A Vietnamese design note outlines a later “Spaceship” update:
  • Ship NFTs with star-levels (1-5), upgradeable for higher stats.
  • Manual “Skill” activations with multi-hour buffs.
  • Durability system repaired by Wingbots; Wingbots are upgradeable.
  • Nuclear-fuel staking boosts returns.
  • Planets have finite resources that regenerate over time. ￼
