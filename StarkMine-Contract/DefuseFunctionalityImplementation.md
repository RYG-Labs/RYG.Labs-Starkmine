# Core Engine Defuse Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the defuse functionality for the StarkMine Core Engine contract, allowing users to burn their engines and receive $MINE tokens in return.

## Contract Changes

### 1. Interface Update (`icore_engine.cairo`)

- **Added Function**: `fn defuse_engine(ref self: TContractState, engine_id: u256) -> u256;`
- **Returns**: The amount of MINE tokens returned to the user

### 2. Event Added (`core_engine.cairo`)

```cairo
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct EngineDefused {
    #[key]
    engine_id: u256,
    #[key]
    owner: ContractAddress,
    refund_amount: u256,
}
```

### 3. Defuse Engine Function Implementation

```cairo
fn defuse_engine(ref self: ContractState, engine_id: u256) -> u256 {
    self.require_not_paused();
    let caller = get_caller_address();
    self.require_approved_or_owner(caller, engine_id);

    let engine = self.engines.read(engine_id);
    assert!(engine.attached_miner == 0, "Cannot defuse attached engine");

    let config = self.engine_type_configs.read(engine.engine_type);
    let owner = self.owner_of(engine_id);

    // Calculate refund amount: 60% of original mint cost based on remaining durability
    let remaining_durability = self.get_engine_remaining_durability(engine_id);
    let durability_percentage = if engine.durability > 0 {
        (remaining_durability * 100) / engine.durability
    } else {
        0
    };

    // Base refund: 40% of mint cost + 20% bonus based on remaining durability
    let base_refund_percentage = 40;
    let bonus_percentage = (durability_percentage * 20) / 100;
    let total_refund_percentage = base_refund_percentage + bonus_percentage;

    let refund_amount = (config.mint_cost * total_refund_percentage.into()) / 100;

    // Burn the NFT
    self._burn(engine_id);

    // Return MINE tokens
    self._return_mine_tokens(owner, refund_amount);

    self.emit(EngineDefused { engine_id, owner, refund_amount });

    refund_amount
}
```

### 4. Helper Functions Added

- **`_burn(engine_id)`**: Burns the NFT and clears all associated data
- **`_return_mine_tokens(to, amount)`**: Returns MINE tokens to the user (TODO: implement token transfer)

## Refund Calculation Logic

The defuse functionality uses a fair refund system:

1. **Base Refund**: 40% of the original mint cost
2. **Durability Bonus**: Up to 20% additional based on remaining durability
3. **Total Refund Range**: 40% - 60% of original mint cost

### Examples:

- **New Engine** (100% durability): 40% + 20% = **60% refund**
- **Half-Used Engine** (50% durability): 40% + 10% = **50% refund**
- **Nearly Expired Engine** (5% durability): 40% + 1% = **41% refund**
- **Expired Engine** (0% durability): 40% + 0% = **40% refund**

## Safety Features

### Contract-Level Restrictions:

- ✅ Only engine owner can defuse
- ✅ Cannot defuse attached engines
- ✅ Contract must not be paused
- ✅ Engine must exist and be owned by caller

### User-Level Protection:

- ✅ Confirmation dialog before defusing
- ✅ Clear warning about irreversibility
- ✅ Shows estimated refund amount

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. New Hook Added

```typescript
const { sendAsync: defuseEngine, isPending: isDefusing } =
	useScaffoldWriteContract({
		contractName: "CoreEngine",
		functionName: "defuse_engine",
		args: [BigInt(0)],
	});
```

### 2. Event Listener Added

```typescript
const { data: engineDefusedEvents } = useScaffoldEventHistory({
	contractName: "CoreEngine",
	eventName: "starkmine::nft::core_engine::CoreEngine::EngineDefused",
	fromBlock: STARKMINE_FROMBLOCK,
	watch: true,
});
```

### 3. Handler Function

```typescript
const handleDefuseEngine = async (engineId: bigint, engineType: string) => {
	try {
		const confirmed = window.confirm(
			`Are you sure you want to defuse this ${engineType} engine? This action cannot be undone.\n\n` +
				`You will receive back a percentage of the original mint cost based on the engine's remaining durability.`
		);

		if (!confirmed) return;

		await defuseEngine({
			args: [engineId],
		});
		notification.success(
			`Engine defused successfully! MINE tokens returned to your wallet.`
		);
		setRefreshTrigger((prev) => prev + 1);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error defusing engine:", error);
		notification.error("Failed to defuse engine");
	}
};
```

### 4. UI Components Added

#### Defuse Button

- 💥 **Defuse Engine** button (only shown for unattached engines)
- Loading spinner during transaction
- Error state styling (red button)
- Tooltip with explanation

#### Information Alerts

- **Engine-Miner Compatibility** (existing)
- **Engine Defusing** (new warning alert explaining the feature)

## Engine Types & Costs

| Engine Type | Mint Cost | 40% Refund | 60% Refund (New) |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| **Basic**   | 500 MINE  | 200 MINE   | 300 MINE         |
| **Elite**   | 1500 MINE | 600 MINE   | 900 MINE         |
| **Pro**     | 3000 MINE | 1200 MINE  | 1800 MINE        |
| **GIGA**    | 5000 MINE | 2000 MINE  | 3000 MINE        |
