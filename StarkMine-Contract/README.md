# StarkMine

A decentralized mining game built on Starknet featuring tier-based NFT miners, core engines, merge mechanics, and dynamic reward distribution with monthly halving tokenomics.

## üéÆ What is StarkMine?

StarkMine is a blockchain-based mining simulation game that combines NFT collecting, strategic upgrades, and DeFi tokenomics. Players own virtual mining operations that generate real cryptocurrency rewards through an innovative proof-of-work simulation built on Starknet.

### üéØ Core Concept

Think of StarkMine as owning a digital mining farm where:

- **NFT Miners** are your mining rigs that generate hash power
- **Core Engines** are upgrades that boost your mining efficiency
- **Mining Stations** provide account-wide multipliers to all your operations
- **MINE Tokens** are the rewards you earn from successful mining
- **Merge System** allows you to combine miners for more powerful equipment

## üîÑ How It Works

### The Mining Loop

```
1. Mint/Buy Miners ‚Üí 2. Attach Core Engines ‚Üí 3. Start Mining ‚Üí 4. Earn MINE Tokens
                                                        ‚Üì
6. Merge for Higher Tiers ‚Üê 5. Upgrade Station ‚Üê 4. Reinvest Earnings
```

### 1. **Get Your First Miner**

- **Basic Miners** (75 STRK): Perfect for beginners, provides 10 TH/s hash power
- **Elite Miners** (20,000 MINE): More powerful at 30 TH/s with 20% efficiency bonus
- Each miner is a unique NFT that you fully own and control

### 2. **Boost Performance with Core Engines**

- **Standard Engine** (+20% efficiency, 500 MINE, 30 days): Entry-level boost
- **Premium Engine** (+35% efficiency, 1,500 MINE, 45 days): Balanced upgrade
- **Elite Engine** (+50% efficiency, 3,000 MINE, 60 days): Maximum performance
- Engines have durability and need replacement over time

### 3. **Scale Up with Mining Stations**

Mining stations provide account-wide multipliers that boost ALL your miners:

- **Level 1** (+10% to all miners, 2,000 MINE)
- **Level 2** (+25% to all miners, 5,000 MINE)
- **Level 3** (+50% to all miners, 12,000 MINE)
- **Level 4** (+100% to all miners, 30,000 MINE)

### 4. **Earn Through Mining**

Your miners automatically generate MINE tokens based on:

- **Base Hash Power**: Determined by miner tier
- **Engine Boost**: Temporary efficiency multiplier
- **Station Multiplier**: Permanent account-wide bonus
- **Network Difficulty**: Adjusts based on total network hash power
- **Time**: Longer mining = more rewards

**Example Calculation:**

```
Basic Miner (10 TH/s) + Premium Engine (+35%) + Level 2 Station (+25%)
= 10 √ó 1.35 √ó 1.25 = 16.875 TH/s effective hash power
```

### 5. **Advanced Gameplay: Merging**

Combine lower-tier miners to create powerful ones:

**Elite ‚Üí Pro Merger**:

- Success Rate: 5% base (+1% per previous failure, max 25%)
- Cost: 1,000 MINE + 125 STRK per attempt
- Result: Pro Miner (70 TH/s, +35% efficiency bonus)
- Supply Cap: Only 200 Pro miners can exist

**Pro ‚Üí GIGA Merger**:

- Success Rate: 1% base (+1% per previous failure, max 51%)
- Cost: 5,000 MINE + 125 STRK per attempt
- Result: GIGA Miner (160 TH/s, +50% efficiency bonus)
- Supply Cap: Only 50 GIGA miners can exist
- 24-hour cooldown between attempts

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Monthly Halving Mechanism

- Mining rewards automatically halve every ~30 days (1,296,000 blocks)
- Creates deflationary pressure and long-term value appreciation
- Early participants earn more, incentivizing early adoption

### Token Distribution

- **70%** - Mining Rewards (distributed to players)
- **10%** - Team Allocation
- **10%** - Development Fund
- **10%** - Liquidity Provision

### Burn Mechanics

- **30%** of all mining rewards are permanently burned
- Reduces total supply over time
- Creates additional deflationary pressure beyond halving

### Supply Caps Create Scarcity

- **Basic**: 10,000 miners (common, STRK minting)
- **Elite**: 1,000 miners (rare, MINE minting)
- **Pro**: 200 miners (very rare, merge-only)
- **GIGA**: 50 miners (ultra rare, merge-only)

## üéØ Player Strategies

### Beginner Strategy

1. Mint a Basic miner with STRK
2. Buy a Standard engine for immediate boost
