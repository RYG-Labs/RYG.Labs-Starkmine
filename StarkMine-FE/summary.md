# Summary of Changes

## Account Abstraction Implementation

1. Modified `src/view/Home/components/UnityCanvas.tsx`:

    - Added account abstraction configuration with gas sponsoring
    - Implemented automatic session key creation when account connects
    - Added session key state management
    - Removed signing requirements for minting operations
    - Added Unity message handlers for minting and session key status
    - Updated Mint function to use API endpoint instead of direct contract interaction

2. Created API endpoint for gasless NFT claiming:
    - Added `/api/write` route for backend-signed transactions
    - Implemented Engine API integration for claiming NFTs
    - Added error handling and response formatting
    - Used environment variables for configuration

## Updated Mint Function

1. **Updated Mint Component in `UnityCanvas copy.tsx`**:
    - Replaced direct contract interaction with API call to `/api/write/create-player`
    - Added loading state with visual feedback during API request
    - Added error handling and display
    - Implemented Unity message communication:
        - `ReceiveMintSuccess`: Sends transaction hash on success
        - `ReceiveMintError`: Sends error message on failure
    - Added TypeScript type declarations for Unity interface
    - Improved UX with disabled button state during transaction

## Error Fixes

1. **AA21 Error Fix (didn't pay prefund)**:

    - Updated account abstraction configuration:
        - Added `gasless: true` flag
        - Configured ThirdWeb's default paymaster
        - Added bundler URL configuration
    - Modified session key permissions:
        - Set `nativeTokenLimitPerTransaction` to "0"
        - Removed unsupported gas configurations

2. **Fixed smartAccount reference in GetCurrentSessionKey function**:

    - Removed separate GetCurrentSessionKey component
    - Integrated session key viewing functionality directly into UnityCanvas component
    - Used useActiveAccount hook to get the current account
    - Made the function properly handle both connected and disconnected states
    - Avoided using useReadContract hook which was causing rendering issues
    - Used direct function calls instead of hooks for better control flow
    - Verified working functionality with Playwright test

3. **Fixed React hooks order error in Mint component**:
    - Moved the conditional check `if (!account) return null;` after useState hook declarations
    - Ensured hooks are always executed in the same order on every render
    - Resolved "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error

## Key Features Added

1. **Automatic Session Key Creation**:

    - Creates session key when account connects
    - Sets permissions for approved contract targets
    - 24-hour validity period for session keys
    - Notifies Unity of session key status

2. **Gasless Minting via API**:

    - Replaced direct contract interaction with API endpoint call
    - Added loading state and user feedback
    - Implemented error handling with clear messaging
    - Simplified minting process with backend wallet signing

3. **Backend-Signed Transactions**:

    - Created API route for backend wallet-signed transactions
    - Used Engine API for executing smart contract calls
    - Implemented ERC-721 NFT claiming functionality
    - Configured proper authorization and error handling

4. **Unity Integration**:
    - Added new Unity message handlers:
        - `ReceiveSessionKeyCreated`: Notifies when session key is created
        - `ReceiveMintSuccess`: Notifies of successful minting
        - `ReceiveMintError`: Notifies of minting failures
    - Removed signature-related message handlers

    - Test gasless minting
    - Test backend-signed NFT claiming API
    - Confirm Unity message handling
2. Monitor transaction success rates
3. Verify gas sponsoring is working correctly

## Unity Integration Guide

To integrate with the updated functionality in Unity:

1. **Connect Wallet**:

    - Call `HandleConnectButton()`
    - Listen for `ReceiveWalletAddressData` response

2. **Mint NFT**:

    - Call `HandleMint()`
    - Listen for `ReceiveMintSuccess` or `ReceiveMintError`

3. **Claim NFT via API**:

    - Make HTTP POST request to `/api/write/create-player`
    - Include user's wallet address in request body
    - Handle success/error responses

4. **Session Management**:
    - Listen for `ReceiveSessionKeyCreated` status
    - Use `HandleClearSessionButton()` to disconnect
